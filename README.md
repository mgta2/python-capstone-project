# Python Capstone Project

My final project of Coding Nomads' https://codingnomads.co/courses/python-bootcamp-online/

## Build a Game using PyGame

The aim of my project is to learn the external package, PyGame, by building a 2D game.

The star, supernova and spaceship images used are from https://www.seekpng.com/ and the background images were also free to download.

## Game Design

The player uses their mouse cursor to control a spaceship. If the player's spaceship is hit by an enemy spaceship, they lose a life. At any one time, a star will be present on the screen. When the player passes over the star, it goes supernova. This explosion destroys any enemy ships in the area.

The aim of the game is to achieve a high score by destroying as many enemy ships as possible. The game's difficulty increases as the player's score increases. The game returns to the title screen when the player runs out of lives.

The game is designed in an Object-Oriented manner.
